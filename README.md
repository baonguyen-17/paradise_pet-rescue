## Background
Starting out as a semester-long group project at Valencia Community College, this website serves as the cornerstone of the members' programming skills, particularly website designing and database management, with a touch of server hosting. Inspired by an actual animal rescue organization, we set out to design a full website for a legitimate organization, along with learning more about the miscellaneous components that contribute effectively to the website. Our mission statement for the website:
> Connect lost pet souls to their new, permanent, loving homes
